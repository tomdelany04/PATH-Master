# Background and Problem

This template has been produced using the `posterdown` package. It generates a standard conference-style poster layout.

<!-- You can add references by inserting the following ^[reference details here] -->

Most treatment decisions are based on average treatment effects derived from randomised controlled trials. While RCTs remain the gold standard for estimating causal effects, reliance on average effects from selected trial populations may not reflect treatment response in individual patients. Subgroup analyses, although simple and interpretable, suffer from well-established limitations, including high rates of false positives and negatives and an inability to inform individual treatment decisions^1. redictive approaches to treatment effect heterogeneity (PATH) are methods of increasing importance in precision medicine, designed to determine the reason for different responses in patients to the the same treatment. To achieve this, risk- and effect-based models are constructed, aiming to provide a patient's expected outcome at the individual-level with versus without treatment

## Objectives of Project

1.  Implement and evaluate predictive HTE models across multiple clinical datasets
2.  Compare risk-based and effects-based approaches in practice
3.  Assess the clinical relevance and reporting implications of PATH analyses

# Data Sources and Datasets

The syntax in this poster template and the `posterdown` package uses the same workflow approach as the R Markdown you know and love.

You can even use the bibliography the same way: Our data were taken from a cluster-randomised trial [^2], available from the [Irish Social Science Data Archive](https://www.ucd.ie/issda/data/).

<!-- This #### below causes the columns to break -->

<!-- You can change where you put these breaks, and the "column_numbers: 4" argument in the YAMLS header to change the layout of the poster, with care! -->

# Early Results / Descriptive Statistics of Datasets

Usually you want to have a nice table displaying some important results that you have calculated. In `posterdown` this is as easy as using the `kable` table formatting you are probably use to as per typical R Markdown formatting.

You can reference tables like so: Table \@ref(tab:mytable). Some basic summaries of the dataset are below:

```{r mytable, out.width='80%'}
knitr::kable(iris[1:10, 1:4], caption = 'Table caption.',align = 'c',"html") %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 20)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot), and Figure \@ref(fig:morefigs) below show the patterns in our dataset. Make sure that all the details in your plots will be legible when printed (legend text, axis text, and any labels)

```{r standard-plot, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Great figure!', fig.height=4}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r morefigs, out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Amazing, right?!', fig.height=4}

df1 <- data.frame(dose=c("D0.5", "D1", "D2"),
                len=c(4.2, 10, 29.5))
ggplot(df1, aes(x=dose, y=len, fill=dose)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  theme_minimal()

```

You can even make your plots interactive for the HTML version of the poster. You can use the HTML poster for the presentation session, and the PDF poster will be printed - so be sure the static version looks okay.

```{r interactiveplot, out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Amazing, right?!', fig.height=4}

gapminder <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datavizpyr/data/master/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
df2 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year %in% c(1952,2007)) %>%
  filter(continent=="Asia") 

df2 <- df2 %>%
  mutate(paired = rep(1:(n()/2),each=2),
         year=factor(year))

p <- df2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= lifeExp, y= country)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = paired)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=year), size=4) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="top")


ggplotly(p)

```

# Next Project Steps

We plan to conduct further analysis using:

-   Variable discombobulation [^3]
-   Expand our minds with explosive machine learning [^4].

[^4]: Smith et al. 1991 doi: 12.36.486

We will use the `plasticanalysis` package for this.
