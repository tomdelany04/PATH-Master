# Background and Problem

<!-- You can add references by inserting the following ^[reference details here] -->

• Relying on average trial effects ignores that real patients differ in demographics, disease severity, and behaviors (HTE) [^1].

• Traditional subgroup analyses (one variable at a time) have low power, high false positives, and aren’t truly patient-centred.

• Predictive approaches to treatment effect heterogeneity (PATH) model risk and treatment effects to estimate individual patient outcomes across treatments [^2].

## Objectives of Project

1.  Implement and evaluate predictive HTE models across multiple clinical datasets
2.  Compare risk-based and effects-based approaches in practice
3.  Assess the clinical relevance and reporting implications of PATH analyses

# Data Sources and Datasets
Analyses are based on published clinical trial data from the GUSTO-I trial [^3] and the Digitalis Investigation Group trial [^4].

# Early Results / Descriptive Statistics of Datasets



```{r fig-forest, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Forest plot of treatment heterogeneity", out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("Forest_gusto.png")

```

Above is a Forest Plot which display the PATH (risk-based) subgroups alongside traditional subgroups (Age, Sex, Location of MI). Low risk according to the linear predictor (lp<-2.36) implies low benefit (<1%); higher risk, higher benefit (>2%).

```{r fig-proportional, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Absolute treatment benefit increases with baseline risk", out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("absolute_benefit.png")

```

The solid red curve shows the expected absolute risk reduction under a proportional treatment effect model, illustrating increasing benefit with higher baseline risk. Blue points show observed absolute risk reductions within risk-based subgroups, with 95% confidence intervals.

# Next Project Steps

We plan to conduct further analysis on the International Stroke Trial and the National Lung screening Trial, to evaluate the generalizability of predictive approaches to treatment-effect heterogeneity across different clinical domain. We also plan to implement a machine-learning approach using causal forests to estimate individualized treatment effects [^5].

We will use the `grf` package for this.
