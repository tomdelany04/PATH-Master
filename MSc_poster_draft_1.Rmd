# Background

<!-- You can add references by inserting the following ^[reference details here] -->

• Relying on average trial effects ignores that patients differ in demographics, disease severity, and behaviors (HTE) [^1], crucially, these factors may modify the effectiveness of treatment.

• Traditional subgroup analyses (one variable at a time) have low power, high false positives, and aren’t truly patient-centred.

• Predictive approaches to treatment effect heterogeneity (PATH) model risk and treatment effects to estimate individual patient outcomes across treatments [^2].

[^2]: Willke et al. 2012, doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-12-185

## Objectives

1.  Implement and evaluate predictive HTE models across multiple clinical datasets
2.  Compare risk-based and effects-based approaches in practice
3.  Assess the clinical relevance and reporting implications of PATH analyses

# Data Sources
Analyses are based on published clinical trial data from the GUSTO-I trial [^3] and the Digitalis Investigation Group trial [^4].

# Early Results


```{r fig-baseline, out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Baseline Risk', fig.height=4}
knitr::include_graphics("Baseline_Mortality_risk_by_risk_group.png") 

```



```{r fig-forest, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Forest plot of treatment heterogeneity", out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}

library(metafor)

# loading saved rds
pack <- readRDS("gusto_forest_pack.rds")

data.subgroups <- pack$data_subgroups
res <- pack$res

par(mar=c(4,4,1,2))
par(fg="maroon")


forest(res, 
       xlim=c(-1.2,0.8), 
       at=log(c(0.5, 1)), 
       alim=c(log(0.2), log(2)), 
       atransf=exp,
       adj=1,
       cex=.9, ylim=c(0, 22),
       rows=c(1:2, (4:5)-.5, 6:7, 10:13, 15),
       xlab="", mlab="", psize=1, lwd = 1.5, addfit=F,
       col = "maroon",
       shade = F)

# Right-side OR header (pulled left)
text(.8, 18, "OR [95% CI]", font=2, adj=1, cex=.9)


# Left-side title (pulled right)

```

Above is a Forest Plot which display the PATH (risk-based) subgroups alongside traditional subgroups (Age, Sex, Location of MI). Low risk according to the linear predictor (lp<-2.36) implies low benefit (<1%); higher risk, higher benefit (>2%).

```{r fig-HTE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Forest plot of treatment heterogeneity", out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("DIG_HTE_Forest_Plot.png")

```


```{r fig-proportional, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Absolute treatment benefit increases with baseline risk", out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("absolute_benefit.png")

```

The solid red curve shows the expected absolute risk reduction under a proportional treatment effect model, illustrating increasing benefit with higher baseline risk. Blue points show observed absolute risk reductions within risk-based subgroups, with 95% confidence intervals.

# Next Steps

We plan to conduct further analysis on the International Stroke Trial and the National Lung screening Trial, to evaluate the generalizability of predictive approaches to treatment-effect heterogeneity across different clinical domain. We also plan to implement a machine-learning approach using causal forests to estimate individualized treatment effects [^5].

We will use the `grf` package for this.
