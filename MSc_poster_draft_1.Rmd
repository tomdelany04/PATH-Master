# Background and Problem

<!-- You can add references by inserting the following ^[reference details here] -->

• Relying on average trial effects ignores that real patients differ in demographics, disease severity, and behaviors (HTE) [^1].

• Traditional subgroup analyses (one variable at a time) have low power, high false positives, and aren’t truly patient-centred.

• Predictive approaches to treatment effect heterogeneity (PATH) model risk and treatment effects to estimate individual patient outcomes across treatments [^2].

[^2]: Willke et al. 2012, doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-12-185

## Objectives of Project

1.  Implement and evaluate predictive HTE models across multiple clinical datasets
2.  Compare risk-based and effects-based approaches in practice
3.  Assess the clinical relevance and reporting implications of PATH analyses

# Data Sources and Datasets
Analyses are based on published clinical trial data from the GUSTO-I trial [^3] and the Digitalis Investigation Group trial [^4]. 

[^3]: The GUSTO investigators, 1993, doi: 10.1056/NEJM199309023291001
[^4]: The Digitalis Investigation Group, Feb. 1997, doi: 10.1056/NEJM199702203360801

# Early Results / Descriptive Statistics of Datasets

You can reference tables like so: Table \@ref(tab:mytable). Some basic summaries of the dataset are below:

```{r mytable, out.width='80%'}

```

Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot), and Figure \@ref(fig:morefigs) below show the patterns in our dataset. Make sure that all the details in your plots will be legible when printed (legend text, axis text, and any labels)

```{r standard-plot, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Great figure!', fig.height=4}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```



You can even make your plots interactive for the HTML version of the poster. You can use the HTML poster for the presentation session, and the PDF poster will be printed - so be sure the static version looks okay.

```{r fig-forest, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 3: Forest plot of treatment heterogeneity", out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("Forest_gusto.png")

```

Above is a Forest Plot which display the PATH (risk-based) subgroups alongside traditional subgroups (Age, Sex, Location of MI). Low risk according to the linear predictor (lp<-2.36) implies low benefit (<1%); higher risk, higher benefit (>2%).

```{r fig-proportional, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 4: Absolute treatment benefit increases with baseline risk", out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("absolute_benefit.png")

```

# Next Project Steps

We plan to conduct further analysis on the International Stroke Trial and the National Lung screening Trial, to evaluate the generalizability of predictive approaches to treatment-effect heterogeneity across different clinical domain. We also plan to implement a machine-learning approach using causal forests to estimate individualized treatment effects [^5].

We will use the `grf` package for this.
